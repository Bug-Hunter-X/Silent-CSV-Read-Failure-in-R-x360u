This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in R: silent failure when attempting to read a file that does not exist. The provided `bug.r` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.r` offers a robust solution.  The issue is that the error handling is too general and doesn't diagnose the problem appropriately.  The solution demonstrates better error handling practices.
